# To-Do List

This project is a simple To-Do List application where I explore Bootstrap and React. As part of my journey as a software engineer, I've used React's component-based architecture and Bootstrap's design elements to create a user-friendly task manager. 


## Features
- Add items to the list
- Remove items from the list
- Toggle between Dark and Light themes
- View current Date & Time
- Utilize local storage for data persistence
